# Installation
Current setup relies on Fedora custom install.
```bash

# Issues & Ideas
nvimtree pane picker should have a color -> green?
colorizer does not work when theme is changed?
awesome build config based on profile, not on hostname
synchronize colors based on config.yml for alacritty, vim, tmux, delta, zathura
work on packer installing everything on the first boot
fix theme switcher
vim cursorrow only when focused tmux pane?
handle secrets
  checkout ansible vault
  gpg encrypted ssh config
  gpg encrypted tmuxinator config
